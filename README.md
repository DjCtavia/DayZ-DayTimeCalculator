# DayZ-DayTimeCalculator

It's basicly a tool for calculate the duration of a day.
Without modification, a normal day in DayZ is equivalent to the usual day (24 hours duration).

But with this tool, we can obtain a specific duration from hours, minutes and seconds, and convert this duration into multiplication.
Day and Night time cycle can be speed up too, or slowed down.
